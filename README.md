This is an opinionated template for Kotlin JVM applications, using the latest Gradle and Kotlin.

This repository contains a root project `myapp-project`, a subproject `myapp`, and Github workflows for building and publishing the project as a package on Github Packages and on Maven Central.

To make this application your own, find-and-replace the following terms:
- `Virtlink` -> your GitHub username
- `com.example` -> the project's group
- `myapp` -> the project's name
Also, replace the license at the bottom of this file and in the `LICENSE` file.


## Quick Start
To build the project:

```shell
./gradlew build
```
